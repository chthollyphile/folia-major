/**
 * The window's one way out to the AI text services (Gemini, OpenAI and OpenAI-compatible hosts).
 * The app asks them for three things: a theme made from a song's lyrics, a segmentation of lyric
 * lines into words, and the connection test of the settings form. This file is the only place in
 * src/ that knows how those asks leave the window: the desktop bridge (window.electron's
 * generateTheme, segmentLyrics and testAiConnection) and our own web routes (/api/generate-theme,
 * /api/generate-theme_openai, /api/segment-lyrics).
 *
 * The window never sends a request to a service itself. The only key it handles is the one typed
 * into the settings form, which it hands to the main process to store or to test. On the desktop
 * the main process sends the request, with the service and the key from the user's settings
 * (electron/aiTextClient.cjs, behind the IPC handlers in electron/main.cjs). On the web our
 * serverless routes send it, with the deployment's key (worker/, and api-ts/ built into api/;
 * segmentation in shared/lyricSegmentationService.mjs). Which service the web build uses is the
 * deployment's choice, read by ./runtimeConfig.
 *
 * It lives in src/services/ because the theme controller, the OBS overlay, the lyric segmentation
 * and the settings form all use it, and none of them owns it.
 *
 * The settings form also reads the provider registry through here (presets, sites, default and
 * retired models: shared/ai/providerRegistry.mjs), so no component imports shared/ai/ itself.
